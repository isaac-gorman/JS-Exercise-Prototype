  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window/ Global Binding: This is the value of "this" in the console wich is the entire JS language.
  2. Implicit Binding: The most utalized appication of the this keyword. Basically you can identify what "this" is by just looking to the left of the dot. "this" is being called on that object. The ability for the "this" to be called on whatever it is being called on allows for modular code, and results depinding on what the "this" key word is being called on. 
  3. New Binding: Used with constructor functions "this" keyword refers to specific instance of the object that is created. Takes the value of whaterer argument you pass within the new Object of the constructure function. "this" keyword enalbles constructure functions to be modular and to be able to create new objects depeinding on what is passed as arguments. 
  4. Explicit Binding: Whenever we specifically apply a method to explictly create subclassed constructors. Any time we use the .call(), .apply(), or .bind() methods.
